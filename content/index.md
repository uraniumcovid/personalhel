# about the page

this is a somewhat desperate attempt at organizing my notes and thoughts into something useful. it is a hel(l) of my own making.

the page is structured as an [[obsidian|obsidian vault]] using [[johnny decimal system|the johnny decimal system]].
i hate [[capital letter|capital letters]], so i have used [the bauhaus idea of small letters only](https://www.bauhaus-bookshelf.org/bauhaus_writing_in_small_letters_lower_case_only.html), and you will only find capital letters used for [[math]] or stuff like [[si units]].

the site is probably best navigated using the graph tool or the explorer on the left.

if you have bad taste, the sites has a [[light mode]] too. i should probably find a way to disable this.

sections 10-19 will contain math notes and 20-29 is cs notes.
